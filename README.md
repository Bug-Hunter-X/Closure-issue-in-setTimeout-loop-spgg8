This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue within `setTimeout` loops. The code in `bug.js` illustrates the problem where the expected behavior of logging numbers 0-9 is not achieved due to closure issues. The solution, presented in `bugSolution.js`, provides a corrected version using `let` in a immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to capture the value of `i` correctly.
